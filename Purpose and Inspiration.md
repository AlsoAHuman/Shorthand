# Purpose and Inspiration

  I have watched how students, teachers, and parents alike have trouble navigating through the complex maze that is Canvas. 
  I suffered first hand as a student, sometimes missing assignments that I didn't even know existed. 
  The goal of Shorthand is to streamline the Canvas interface and allow students and teachers to better keep track of what needs to get done.

  This project to inspiration from the project nala, a frontend to apt, which makes improvements to function and ease of use.
  Furthermore, this project took inspiration from my original solution to the canvas problem, using a spreadsheet with a wonderful custom-made formatting.
  However the major downside to the spreadsheet is the need for manual input of the data.
  This project hopes to be the successor to the spreadsheet and overcome the original solutions flaws.
